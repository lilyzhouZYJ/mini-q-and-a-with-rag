["Chapter 1\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\n\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\n\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d\n\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\n\u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n\n\u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently.\n\n\u201cYOU want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d\n\nThis was invitation enough.\n\n\u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cBingley.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he married or single?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d\n\n\u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving HER the preference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he; \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.\u201d\n\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. HER mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n\nChapter 2\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him", "\u201cMr. Bennet, how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me.

The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.\n\nChapter 2\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:\n\n\u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more have I,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; \u201cand I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven\u2019s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cKitty has no discretion in her coughs,\u201d said her father; \u201cshe times them ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not cough for my own amusement,\u201d replied Kitty fretfully. \u201cWhen is your next ball to be, Lizzy?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo-morrow fortnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, so it is,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cand Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to HER.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honour your circumspection. A fortnight\u2019s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if WE do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.\u201d\n\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \u201cNonsense, nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he. \u201cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you THERE. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\u201d\n\nMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\n\n\u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return to Mr. Bingley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\u201d\n\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.\n\n\u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about", ", \u201clet us return to Mr. Bingley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to hear THAT; but why did not you tell me that before?

At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you ARE the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Lydia stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I AM the youngest, I\u2019m the tallest.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.\n\nChapter 3\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways\u2013with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley\u2019s heart were entertained.\n\n\u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d\n\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.\n\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London\u2013his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether\u2013Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had", ".

And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether\u2013Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\n\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.\n\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.\n\nElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\n\n\u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Mr. Bingley, \u201cfor a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n\u201cOh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: \u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt ME; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\u201d\n\nMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him.", " several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n\n\u201cOh!

Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n\nThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.\n\n\u201cOh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of THAT, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the BOULANGER\u2013\u201c\n\n\u201cIf he had had any compassion for ME,\u201d cried her husband impatiently, \u201che would not have danced half so much! For God\u2019s sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\u2019s gown\u2013\u201c\n\nHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u201d\n\nChapter 4\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.\n\n\u201cHe is just what a young man ought to be,\u201d said she, \u201csensible, good-humoured, lively", " another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n\n\u201cBut I can assure you,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.

His character is thereby complete.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take YOU by surprise, and ME never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Lizzy!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you do; and it is THAT which makes the wonder. With YOUR good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough\u2013one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design\u2013to take the good of everybody\u2019s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad\u2013belongs to you alone. And so you like this man\u2019s sisters, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not\u2013at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.\u201d\n\nElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\n\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\n\nHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table\u2013nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited", " on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.\n\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.

Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour\u2013was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\n\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\u2019s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.\n\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.\n\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\u2013but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\n\nChapter 5\nWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James\u2019s had made him courteous.\n\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth\u2019s intimate friend.\n\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n\n\u201cYOU began the evening well, Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. \u201cYOU were Mr. Bingley\u2019s first choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; but he seemed to like his second better", ", occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.

To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her\u2013indeed I rather believe he DID\u2013I heard something about it\u2013but I hardly know what\u2013something about Mr. Robinson.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson\u2019s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and WHICH he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: \u2018Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed\u2013that does seem as if\u2013but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS, Eliza,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cMr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?\u2013poor Eliza!\u2013to be only just TOLERABLE.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg you would not put it into Lizzy\u2019s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you quite sure, ma\u2019am?\u2013is not there a little mistake?\u201d said Jane. \u201cI certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye\u2013because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Bingley told me,\u201d said Jane, \u201cthat he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With THEM he is remarkably agreeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cbut I wish he had danced with Eliza.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother time, Lizzy,\u201d said her mother, \u201cI would not dance with HIM, if I were you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe, ma\u2019am, I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis pride,\u201d said Miss Lucas, \u201cdoes not offend ME so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a RIGHT to be proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is very true,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cand I could easily forgive HIS pride, if he had not mortified MINE.\u201d\n\n\u201cPride,\u201d observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, \u201cis a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\u201d cried a young Lucas, who came", " favour, should think highly of himself.

I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet; \u201cand if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly.\u201d\n\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\n\nChapter 6\nThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet\u2019s pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with THEM was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother\u2019s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he DID admire her and to HER it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\n\n\u201cIt may perhaps be pleasant,\u201d replied Charlotte, \u201cto be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all BEGIN freely\u2013a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show MORE affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\u2019s disposition as you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its", " partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.

But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely DINED with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together\u2013and four evenings may do a great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\u201d\n\nOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley\u2019s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.\n\nHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\u2019s, where a large party were assembled.\n\n\u201cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\u201d said she to Charlotte, \u201cby listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\u201d\n\nOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\n\n\u201cDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be HER turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am", ", \u201cby listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.

If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.\u201d On Miss Lucas\u2019s persevering, however, she added, \u201cVery well, if it must be so, it must.\u201d And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, \u201cThere is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: \u2018Keep your breath to cool your porridge\u2019; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.\u201d\n\nHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\n\nMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.\n\nMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\n\n\u201cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\u201d\n\nSir William only smiled. \u201cYour friend performs delightfully,\u201d he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \u201cand I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d\n\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n\u201cI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself\u2013for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:\n\n\u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\u201d And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:\n\n\u201cIndeed, sir", " a house in town, I conclude?\u201d\n\nMr. Darcy bowed.\n\n\u201cI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself\u2013for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d\n\nHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:\n\n\u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?

I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\u201d\n\nMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n\n\u201cYou excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Darcy is all politeness,\u201d said Elizabeth, smiling.\n\n\u201cHe is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance\u2013for who would object to such a partner?\u201d\n\nElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:\n\n\u201cI can guess the subject of your reverie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should imagine not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner\u2013in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise\u2013the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\u201d\n\nMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:\n\n\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\u201d repeated Miss Bingley. \u201cI am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?\u2013and pray, when am I to wish you joy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\u2019s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\u201d\n\nHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\n\nChapter 7\nMr. Bennet\u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\n\nShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\n\nThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish", "ailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.

The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.\n\nTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\u2019 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\u2019s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.\n\nAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:\n\n\u201cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\u201d\n\nCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.\n\n\u201cI am astonished, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody\u2019s children, it should not be of my own, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes\u2013but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well\u2013and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\u2019s in his regimentals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma,\u201d cried Lydia, \u201cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\u2019s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\u2019s library.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,\n\n\u201cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is from Miss Bingley,\u201d said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n\n\u201cMY DEAR FRIEND,\u2013\n\n\u201cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\u2019s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\u2013Yours ever,\n\n\u201cCAROLINE", " replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.

They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you have got them to-day,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmy mother\u2019s purpose will be answered.\u201d\n\nShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.\n\n\u201cThis was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:\n\n\u201cMY DEAREST LIZZY,\u2013\n\n\u201cI find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones\u2013therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me\u2013and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.\u2013Yours, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, \u201cif your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness\u2013if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go an see her if I could have the carriage.\u201d\n\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n\n\u201cHow can you be so silly,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cas to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be very fit to see Jane\u2013which is all I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this a hint to me, Lizzy,\u201d said her father, \u201cto send for the horses?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI admire the activity of your benevolence,\u201d observed Mary, \u201cbut every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will go as far as Meryton with you,\u201d said Catherine", " determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative.

Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.\n\n\u201cIf we make haste,\u201d said Lydia, as they walked along, \u201cperhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\u201d\n\nIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers\u2019 wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n\nShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother\u2019s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion\u2019s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.\n\nHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\n\nWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\n\nWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.\n\nChapter 8\nAt five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\u2019s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not", " it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.

His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n\nWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:\n\n\u201cShe has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must SHE be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour picture may be very exact, Louisa,\u201d said Bingley; \u201cbut this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\u201d said Miss Bingley; \u201cand I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see YOUR sister make such an exhibition.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly not.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\u201d said Bingley.\n\n\u201cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\u201d observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \u201cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied; \u201cthey were brightened by the exercise.\u201d A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\n\n\u201cI have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is capital,\u201d added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n\n\u201cIf they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cit would not make them one jot less agreeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,\u201d replied Darcy.\n\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend\u2019s vulgar relations.\n\nWith a", "st began again:\n\n\u201cI have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.

She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n\n\u201cDo you prefer reading to cards?\u201d said he; \u201cthat is rather singular.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Eliza Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, \u201cdespises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cI am NOT a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\u201d said Bingley; \u201cand I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\u201d\n\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others\u2013all that his library afforded.\n\n\u201cAnd I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into.\u201d\n\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.\n\n\u201cI am astonished,\u201d said Miss Bingley, \u201cthat my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt ought to be good,\u201d he replied, \u201cit has been the work of many generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build YOUR house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish it may.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am talking of possibilities, Charles.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\u201d\n\nElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\n\n\u201cIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\u201d said Miss Bingley; \u201cwill she be as tall as I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet\u2019s height, or rather taller.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is amazing to me,\u201d said Bingley, \u201chow young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a", " she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\n\n\u201cIs Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\u201d said Miss Bingley; \u201cwill she be as tall as I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she will.

I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour list of the common extent of accomplishments,\u201d said Darcy, \u201chas too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor I, I am sure,\u201d said Miss Bingley.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d observed Elizabeth, \u201cyou must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! certainly,\u201d cried his faithful assistant, \u201cno one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this she must possess,\u201d added Darcy, \u201cand to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing ANY.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \u201cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \u201cthere is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\u201d\n\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.\n\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother\u2019s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\n\nChapter 9\nElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\u2019s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.

In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n\nHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n\n\u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n\n\u201cI am sure,\u201d she added, \u201cif it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\u201d replied he; \u201cand therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\u201d said Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\u201d cried he, turning towards her.\n\n\u201cOh! yes\u2013I understand you perfectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cLizzy,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cremember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know before,\u201d continued Bingley immediately, \u201cthat your were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but intricate characters are the MOST amusing. They have at least that advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country,\u201d said Darcy, \u201ccan in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. \u201cI assure you there is quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town.\u201d\n\nEverybody was surprised,", " not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cLizzy,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cremember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know before,\u201d continued Bingley immediately, \u201cthat your were a studier of character.

Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\n\n\u201cI cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I am in the country,\u201d he replied, \u201cI never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye\u2013that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,\u201d looking at Darcy, \u201cseemed to think the country was nothing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\u201d said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. \u201cYou quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\u201d\n\nNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\u2019s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since HER coming away.\n\n\u201cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. THAT is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Charlotte dine with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; MY daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so VERY plain\u2013but then she is our particular friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\u2013one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so ended his affection,\u201d said Elizabeth impatiently. \u201cThere has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love,\u201d said Darcy.\n\n\u201cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\u201d\n\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again", " was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.

She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\u2019s ear:\n\n\u201cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\u201d\n\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \u201cOh! yes\u2013it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given YOUR ball,\u201d she added, \u201cI shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\u201d\n\nMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\u2019 behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of HER, in spite of all Miss Bingley\u2019s witticisms on FINE EYES.\n\nChapter 10\nThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.\n\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.\n\n\u201cHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\u201d\n\nHe made no answer.\n\n\u201cYou write uncommonly fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too!

Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you\u2013but I always mend my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you contrive to write so even?\u201d\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\u201cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her brother, \u201cbecause he does NOT write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\u2013by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself\u2013and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\u201d\n\n\u201cNay,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cthis is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, \u2018Bingley, you had better stay till next week,\u2019 you would probably do it, you would probably not go\u2013and at another word, might stay a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have only proved by this,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cthat Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am exceedingly gratified,\u201d said Bingley, \u201c", " that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.

You have shown him off now much more than he did himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am exceedingly gratified,\u201d said Bingley, \u201cby your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo yield readily\u2013easily\u2013to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all means,\u201d cried Bingley; \u201clet us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\n\n\u201cI see your design, Bingley,\u201d said his friend. \u201cYou dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you ask,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cis no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\u201d\n\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\n\nWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\n\nMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music", ",\u201d said his friend. \u201cYou dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I do.

She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.\n\nAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:\n\n\u201cDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said she, \u201cI heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say \u2018Yes,\u2019 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all\u2013and now despise me if you dare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed I do not dare.\u201d\n\nElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.\n\nMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\n\nShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.\n\n\u201cI hope,\u201d said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, \u201cyou will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth\u2019s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.\u201d\n\nAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.\n\n\u201cI did not know that you intended to walk,\u201d said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\n\n\u201cYou used us abominably ill,\u201d answered Mrs. Hurst, \u201crunning away without telling us that you were coming out.\u201d\n\nThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:\n\n\u201cThis walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into", " judge.

You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\u201d\n\nShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening."]
